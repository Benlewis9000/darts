# Darts

Darts is web application to track your score in a game of darts. The client SPA is built in Angular 18 with TypeScript. The first iteration of the app will allow the user to record their throws and rounds in a traditional game of darts as they work their score down to zero.

## MVP

In the minimal viable product, the user should be able to:

- Record their throw via the UI, for each throw in a round
- See their recorded scores for each round played
- View their current score
